Today, Git is the standard version control software for most projects. It allows you to track changes to your codebase, collaborate with others, and manage your codebase history.

As a Software Engineer, [I've worked on lots of projects and repositories over the years](http://jeffersonbsilva.com/about/#work-experience) using Git. Some of them were personal projects, while others were work-related projects.

If you use a single computer to manage different projects, probably you need to commit using different emails and names. For example, you might use your personal email to commit to your personal projects, and your work email to commit to your work projects. After all, isn't a good idea to commit using your <razor1337@gmail.com> email into your client projects, right? This is where Git profiles can help you.

## What are Git profiles?

Git profiles are a way to manage different Git configurations on the same computer. Each profile can have its own email, name, and other settings.
