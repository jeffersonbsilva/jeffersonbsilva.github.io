Working for the largest airline in Latin America, building a cross-platform application for Android and iOS using React Native.

> Fun fact: I had the opportunity to work for one week at a client site in Santiago, Chile. It was an amazing experience to work with the team in person and explore the city. It was my first time traveling by plane and internationally, and I was really excited about it. :)
