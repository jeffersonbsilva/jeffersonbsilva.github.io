*2025 - Current* – Porto Alegre, Brazil

Working for the largest airline in Latin America, building a cross-platform application for Android and iOS using React Native.

> Random fact: I’ve had the chance to travel to Santiago, Chile three times for work. Each trip was a unique experience. I got to meet the team in person, explore the city, and work together on-site. The first one was special — it was my first time flying and traveling abroad.
